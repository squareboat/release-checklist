1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
1. Capitalize the subject line
1. Do not end the subject line with a period

1. Do not use past-tense like FIXED etc.
1. Do not mix multiple activities in the same commit.


##Git Commit Best Practices

####A commit message should answer three primary questions:

Why is this change necessary?
How does this commit address the issue?
What effects does this change have?

####Standard prefixes to be followed for all commits:

* FIX (For bug fixes with Trello card URL if possible)
* ADD (New features)
* CHANGE (Updating some functionality which is not a bug)
* REFACTOR (Changing an existing feature without any change in overall functionality)
* WIP (Temporary commit only for backup sake)
* REMOVE (Remove a feature)
