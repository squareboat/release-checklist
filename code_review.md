1. Code review by atleast 1 external developer (Who did not build the product)
1. All issues must be noted down on Trello
1. Reviewer must verify that all issues in code review have been fixed
1. Variables like $items, $data have not been used
1. Use of full variable names (first_name instead of fname) (Readability should take precedence over optimization)
1. Large elements of data have not been loaded into memory. Data download (ex. Excel exports) should always be chunked and done asynchronously whenever possible
